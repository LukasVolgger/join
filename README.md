<h1>Join</h1>

Join is a team project of the frontend web developer course at the <a href="https://developerakademie.com/">Developer Akademie</a>. The focus is on HTML, CSS, JS and working with version control Git with multiple collaborators. The Bootstrap design framework was used in this project. <br>
<br>
In this project, the client - server functionality was simulated with a mini-backend (More information can be found in the repository <a href="https://github.com/LukasVolgger/smallest_backend_ever">smallest_backend_ever</a>). The data is not stored locally in local storage but on a server in Json format. <br>
