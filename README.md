# Join
Join is a team project of the frontend web developer course at the [Developer Akademie](https://developerakademie.com/). The focus is on HTML, CSS, JS and working with version control Git with multiple collaborators. The Bootstrap design framework was used in this project.

In this project, the client - server functionality was simulated with a mini-backend (More information can be found in the repository [smallest_backend_ever](https://github.com/LukasVolgger/smallest_backend_ever). The data is not stored locally in local storage but on a server in Json format.
